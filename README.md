# Exam Suite using Socket Programming

## Introduction
The Exam Suite is a networked application built using Socket Programming to facilitate online exams for students. This project aims to provide a secure and efficient platform for conducting exams remotely, ensuring fairness and integrity during the assessment process.

## Features
1. Exam Creation and Management: Instructors can create and manage exams by setting the exam duration, adding questions, and specifying the correct answers.
2. Real-time Exam Delivery: Students can access and take exams within the scheduled duration.
4. Submission and Grading: Students can submit their exam responses, and instructors can grade the exams manually or automatically.
5. Secure Communication: The exam suite ensures secure communication between clients and the server to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Used for implementing the server and client-side scripts.
- Socket Programming: Facilitates communication between the server and clients over the network.
- Encryption and Authentication: Implemented to ensure secure and private data transmission.

## How to Run
1. Set up a server to host the exam suite application. Ensure the server has Python and necessary libraries installed.
2. Clone or download the "Exam Suite" project repository from GitHub.
3. Modify the server and client-side scripts to match your server's IP address and port number
4. Run the server-side script on your server using the following command:

python server.py

6. Run the client-side script on the student's machine using the following command:

python client.py
